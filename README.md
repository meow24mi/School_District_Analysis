# School_District_Analysis

## Overview and Prpose of Project
This analysis aims to provide a more accurate picture of student performance based on student body size, school type, and per capata spending. This revised analysis takes into consideration of the potential contamination of performance for the ninth grade class at Thomas High School, and as a result have excluded their test scores in the dataset. 

## Results
- District Summary

    For the district summary, the average score for math decreased by 0.1 point, while the average reading score remained unchanged. The percentage passing in math decreased by 0.2%, while the percentage passing in reading decreased by 0.3%. Overall percentage passing decreased by 0.9%. 

- School Summary
    
    There was more of a decrease in scores for the school summary, the average score for math decreased by 0.1 point, while the average reading score remained unchanged. The percentage passing in math decreased by 26.36%, while the percentage passing in reading decreased by 27.64%. Overall percentage passing decreased by 25.87%. 

- Replacement of Thomas High School ninth grader scores

    - There was no affect on the math and reading scores of other grades. Thomas High School did not participate in nineth grade comparisons. 
    - The average score for math based on school spending fluctuated down 0.06 and 0.08% down; The average score for reading increased 0.05 and decreased by 0.08%. Percenage passing both reading and math decreased by 0.31%.
    - The scores by school spending was identical
    - The scores by school size was identical
    - The scores by school type was near identical
 
 ## Summary
The updated dataset without the possible contamination of the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High school was neccessiary to ensure the variance if any wasn't significant. As expect, that when the calculations were performed on a larger scale, across type of schools, across all schools the difference was diluted. 

The changes worth noting after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs are decrease average math and reading scores, as well as decreased percentage of passing in math and reading. Logically the overall percentage passing also decreased.
